    <h2>Why I Joined Code Nation</h2>
    <p>I joined Code Nation because I just wasn't happy doing admin / data entry any more and when my work coach at Ingeus told me about Code Nation, I thought "Why not?", as I used to enjoy coding simple programs in Commodore 64 BASIC back in the late 80s and early 90s and also made my own websites in the early 2000s using basic HTML and a little CSS. I am also an avid gamer and think Code Nation could help me turn my passions into a career.</p>

    <p>My ultimate target is to gain employment as a developer, maybe even as a game developer.</p>
